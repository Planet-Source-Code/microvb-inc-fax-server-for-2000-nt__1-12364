## Fax Server for 2000/NT


</div>

### Description

With a small bit of coding, you can modify this app to suit your office server environment as a fully function FAX SERVER. You MUST be running WINDOWS 2000 / WINDOWS NT, as these are the only two OS's that have the FAX SERVER Object.
 
### More Info
 
A small suggestion for making this fit your office environment, is to use Winsock to connect to this application, and effect a method that all clients on the network (this server) could send a fax from thier desktop. TIP: Send the info as a delimited string from the client to the server.
